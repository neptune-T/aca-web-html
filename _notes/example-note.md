## Introduction

This is an example of a note page. You can use standard Markdown to write your content. For example, you can have **bold text**, *italic text*, and `inline code`.

You can also include mathematical notations using LaTeX, which will be beautifully rendered by KaTeX.

### An Inline Equation

Here is an inline equation: $E = mc^2$. The equation is seamlessly integrated within the text.

### A Block Equation

For more complex or important equations, you can use a block display:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

This Gaussian integral is a fundamental result in mathematics and physics. By placing `.md` files in the `_notes` directory, they will automatically be picked up and rendered on the site, making content management simple and efficient.
